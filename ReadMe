# THE POKEMON ARENA

Product: This website will present a gallery of pokemon on the home page. You can select a pokemen and be taken to that pokemons profile page. That page will show that pokemons stats and details about that owner. 
If you choose you can click into the owner to learn more about them and the pokemen they own. 

As a team we are actively choosing a straight forward project and one that we can reference prior code to get us in the flow of working as a team. Our intention is to build an MVP first and then build stretch features on top.

### 1. Team Roles

All of the team will look to support each other in their roles. Roles are to ensure that things run smoothly and that there is control within the team. 

   Team VibeMan: (Gerard) to actively keep an eye on the team 'vibe'. Making sure that no-one is left out of the process and identifying and managing extreme vibes 

   GitHub Manager: (Reubs) manages the set up of and is responsible for git up branches merge and requests. Importantly this role is not a stand alone role e.g. it will not be just Reubs responsibility to review code. 

   SpokesPerson: (Ado) will take responsibility for the plan out and organise the presentation of the product. Can delegate roles. 

   Communications facilitator: Will help facilitate team conversations to ensure forward movement and deep coverage.


### 2. Team norms
[ ] Pair programming and some group work
[ ] Everyone wants to work on routes, Gerard wants to work on the data side. 
[ ] Everyone wants to look at the testing stretch if we get the chance
[ ] Lunch on Friday will be a max of 45mins or shorter if all decided.
[ ] We all agree that we will communicate and be vocal with each other to ensure clarity and comfort with the project moving forward.
[ ] There will always be 'a non-involved' person tasked with reviewing code before it is pushed to main


Rough overarching roll out plan: 
- Create MVP that is live on server and all MVP are met/tested
- Team meeting checkin to decide on stretch
- Assign stretch features
- Build build build
